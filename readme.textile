h3. SETUP

Simply include this class into your project like so:

bc. include_once('/path/to/class.MySQL.php');

Then make sure you have the following definitions set:

bc. MYSQL_HOST
MYSQL_USER
MYSQL_PASS
MYSQL_NAME

I usually include them in a globally included config file.

@MYSQL_HOST@ = The hostname of the MySQL server (usually, but not always, 'localhost').

@MYSQL_USER@ = Your username for the server / database

@MYSQL_PASS@ = Your password for the server / database

@MYSQL_NAME@ = The name of your database

h3. USAGE


To use this class, you'd first init the object like so:

bc. $oMySQL = new MySQL();

The class constructor will perform a connection to the database automatically. To execute statements simply use:

bc. $oMySQL->ExecuteSQL($query);
